\section{Introduction}

The evolution of healthcare in India over 25 years has been a mixed bag. The infant mortality rate and the maternal mortality rate has come down substantially.
According to government’s allocation towards health care as the percentage of gross domestic product has fallen from 1.05% in 2016 from 1.47% in 1987.
IMR had fallen to 41 per 1000 live births in 2013 from 88in 1990
Whereas, MMR from 560 deaths per 100,00 in 1990 to 190 in 2013.

INDIA has failed in citizenry when it comes to expenses on healthcare. According to National sample survey organisation(NSSO),the dependence of Indians on private health services has risen sharply.

\section{report analysis}

In 1986-87, around 60% of the population availed public health services according to 42nd NSSO. whereas by 2014 the trend reversed and around 41% population are availing public health services according to 71st NSSO report.
The NSSO report also shows the out -of- pocket expenditure of the households. People spent around 3,561 rs per hospitalisation in 1995 whereas 18, 268 in 2014.

Out of pocket expenditure is the main cause of worry for the people .
the no. of people fall from above poverty line to below poverty because of the out-of-pocket  expenditure. And nearly 70% of this expenditure is because of medicine.

This rise in expenditure is direly affecting in the fall of government’s budgetary support to healthcare.
In 1980s, public health spending has increased to 1.5% of India’s GDP. But since the trend has been declining which reached to 0.6% of GDP in 1990’s. since then it has increased a bit to 1.2% of GDP, but has reaches nowhere close to 2.5% which is 12th five -year plan target of the government.


 The under-financing reduced the credibility of the public health institutions among general people. and doctors and nurses left the public health institution, creating huge vacancies in primary health and public hospitals.
 
There is increasing risk of communicable and non-communicable diseases too. while, diarrhoea, respiratory infections continues to affect India, non- communicable diseases like chronic cancer, diabetes lead almost 60% of all deaths in India, according to WHO.

The economic burden of these lifestyle diseases accounts for roughly 35%, according to WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM and HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH.

This report further added that probability of dying during the most productive years between 30-70 from one of the non-communicable diseases is staggering 26%.
